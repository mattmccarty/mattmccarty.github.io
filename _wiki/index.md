# Wiki
Engineers face complex problems every day. Many on the internet promise solutions to fulfill our needs. Like the commercial used to say, "We have an app for that." The problem is that it takes time, money, and resources to read through the documentation, install the pieces, familiarize ourselves, and get our company's buy-in. In this industry, time is rarely our side. We perform a quick search and implement a solution that appears to work for most. Once the solution is implemented, we discover missing features or bugs that were overlooked in our initial evaluation. The wiki will serve as a learning and documentation resource for myself and others.

## Categories
The wiki will be divided into various topics. The root of each will contain a synopsis of its underlying contents and can also provide other general information. The subtopics will be more specific. All subtopics should be arranged in a way that allows a novice reader to start from the beginning and work their way down to more advanced information. They should also provide a comparison of all the topics discussed.

## Design
The design should be responsive to support mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. It should also be optimized to take advantage of as much screen real estate as possible. The goal is to provide access to information on any device or location. The design and features will change with time. The current design was created, so that content can start being created and accessed.
