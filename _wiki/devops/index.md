# DevOps

[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) is a philosophical trend. Like the technology behind it, the definition continually evolves. By using cloud technology, it offers solutions to combine development teams with [operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_management). The teams can work alongside each other by using the same set of tools, therefore, minimizing miscommunications. The cloud allows companies to scale their application's infrastructure quickly as resources are needed. This ability gave birth to innovative solutions that continuously build, deploy, and monitor an application and the hardware it runs on. Development teams (dev) can package an application with the entire runtime environment it requires. The runtime includes the entire operating system and application dependencies. With an encapsulated runtime, operations can quickly deploy applications without worrying about the need to configure or install more server-side software. If changes to an application require additional hardware, new tools can scale the infrastructure quickly without human intervention. [Source code management (SCM)](../scm/index.md) software allows the two teams to version their changes. Application and infrastructure changes alike can both roll back to a previous state with a few commands or clicks. It also gives insight into why, what, and when something changed and the employee who changed it.

## Who Qualifies?

DevOps is not for all tech companies. It mainly targets software vendors offering [web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) and [mobile-based applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app), including [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices). If a company delivers other types of software, portions of DevOps may still be applicable, such as [continuous integration](./ci/index.md), [continuous testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_testing), and [continuous delivery](./cd/index.md). It all depends on the application target and requirements. 

## The Catch

Implementing good DevOps practices comes with overhead costs. There are multiple options for every DevOps related challenge, so a significant amount of research is required. Companies need to provide training and invest time. Their workforce needs general knowledge of the subject and time to learn various technologies. They need employees who are engaged and love to learn so that they can apply the right technology to the right problem. DevOps is a philosophy, and if a company wants to adopt it, all of its existing application delivery processes may need to change. Change is expensive and time-consuming.
