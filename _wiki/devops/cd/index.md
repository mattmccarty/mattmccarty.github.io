# Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment (CD) is the implementation of tools and processes which automatically deploy and distribute applications/services to production. The applications/services delivered by CD are usually made available by a [Continous Integration](../ci/index.md) pipeline.

Continuous Deployment is sometimes confused with [Continous Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery), but they are two different, yet similar concepts.
